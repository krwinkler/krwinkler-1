HOMEWORK 2
POKEMON TOURNAMENT

Pokémon, also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a Japanese media franchise managed by
The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise
was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon",
which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.
Works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise
is "Gotta Catch 'Em All".

In this homework, we will simulate a Pokemon tournament. Each pokemon will be a
participant in the tournament. In order to simulate, we have 4 main tasks to complete.
Since later tasks are dependent to the prior ones, you have to complete tasks in order.
Explanation of tasks and a pseudocode is provided to you within each function. However,
tasks can be summarized as:
    1. Importing Participant data from a CSV file: Name of the file will be given to you
       as a parameter. This CSV file does not have any header row. It has 4 fields.
            - 1st Field: Name of the Pokemon
            - 2nd Field: Type of the Pokemon ({Water, Fire, Electric, Grass or Ground})
            - 3rd Field: Health (HP) of the Pokemon
            - 4rd Field: Base Attack Damage of the Pokemon
    2. Calculating the Attack Multiplier: Since some type of pokemons are more powerful
       against some specific types, their power can be enhanced up to some multiplier value.
       This Attack Multiplier is provided as a chart in the function description below.
    3. Fight Simulation: This task will ask you to implement a fight simulation between two
       given participants/pokemons. You have to use the attack multipliers and find out
       which participant wins the fight after how many rounds.
    4. Tournament Simulation: Since we already implemented the fight simulation between two
       participants, we can easily run a tournament. Each participant will play two games against
       the participants which appears after than them in the participants list. We will keep
       track of how many games each participant won in a list, then return this list.

    This function is used for importing a CSV file to our program
    as a list of list. Each row will be stored as a list. Therefore,
    in a very high level view:
        - Your CSV file will be store as a list, where each row
        will be a list inside that list:
        CSV FILE CONTENT: [[ROW1 CONTENT], [ROW2 CONTENT], ...]

    Task Objectives:
    1. Reading a file content
    2. Creating a nested list structure
    3. Type conversion

    Note: Be careful that when you read a file content, even though you read a number,
    its type is interpreted as string (str). Therefore, when you are storing numerical
    values, do not forget to convert its type to float here.
